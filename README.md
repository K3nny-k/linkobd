## Usage

### Connecting to OBD-II Device

1. **Enable Bluetooth** on your device
2. **Grant permissions** when prompted
3. **Tap Connect** on the home screen
4. **Select your OBD-II adapter** from the list
5. **Wait for connection** confirmation

### Using SFD (Storage File Data)

1. **Connect to device** first
2. **Navigate to SFD** screen
3. **Select ECU** from the dropdown (search by name or ID)
4. **Fetch data** from the selected ECU
5. **Send commands** using hex format

### Hex Console

1. **Connect to device**
